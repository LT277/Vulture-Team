# Team-Vulture

## Overview
This car was made for a Highschool AP Computer Science Principles Class. 

This project was planned to be used with Tensorflow in python3. After months of having truble importing images, and only a few days left before the semester ended, we moved to Keras using Tensorflow backend. It still uses tensorflow, but is written using Keras documenation.
