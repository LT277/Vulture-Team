# Team-Vulture

## Overview
This car was made for a Highschool AP Computer Science Principles Class. 

This project uses Keras with TensorFlow backend (TensorFlow using Keras Documentation). The neural network needs to be trained using a seperate program (train.py) than the predictions are made from (predict.py). commsv5.py and predict.py use socket to talk to eachother, and pickle to send the image. commsv5.py also has the ability to take pictures to train the neural network, and it has an RC mode that works through user input (w,s,a,d).



## NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED TO USE ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPLES EXAM
## NOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION
## NOT PACKAGED FOR INDIVIDUAL RESALE
